    """A view to display a list of code snippets."""
    snippets = Snippet.objects.all() # query database
    snippets_list = ','.join([snippet.title for snippet in snippets])
    return HttpResponse(f"List of Snippets: {snippets_list}")
```

(venv-name)$ mkdir -p <app-name>/templates/snippets
```

### Create Template

```
(venv-name)$ cd </path/to/proj-name>
(venv-name)$ mkdir -p <app-name>/templates/snippets
(venv-name)$ vi <app-name>/templates/snippets/snippet_list.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Snippet List</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>List of Snippets</h1>
    <ul>
      {% for snippet in snippets %}
      <li>{{ snippet.title }}: {{ snippet.code }}</li>
      {% empty %}
      <li>No snippets found.</li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Use Template in View

```
(venv-name)$ vi <app-name>/views.py
from django.shortcuts import render

from .models import Snippet

def snippet_list(request):
    """A view to display a list of code snippets."""
    snippets = Snippet.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'snippets/snippet_list.html', {'snippets': snippets})
```

### Use Form in View

```
(venv-name)$ cd </path/to/proj-name>
(venv-name)$ mkdir -p <app-name>/templates/snippets

(venv-name)$ vi <app-name>/forms.py
from django import forms
from .models import Snippet

class SnippetForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Snippet
        fields = ['title', 'code', 'language']

(venv-name)$ vi <app-name>/views.py
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect

from .models import Snippet
from .forms import SnippetForm

def snippet_list(request):
    """A view to display a list of code snippets."""
    snippets = Snippet.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'snippets/snippet_list.html', {'snippets': snippets})

def submit_snippet(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = SnippetForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            return redirect('snippet_list')
    else:
        form = SnippetForm()
        return render(request, 'snippets/submit_snippet.html', {'form': form})

(venv-name)$ vi <app-name>/templates/snippets/submit_snippet.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Submit Snippet</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Submit a New Snippet</h1>
    <form method="post">
      {% csrf_token %}
      {{ form.as_p }}
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>

(venv-name)$ vi <proj-name>/urls.py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path

from cmif.views import snippet_list, submit_snippet
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('snippets/', snippet_list, name='snippet_list'),
    path('submit/', submit_snippet, name='submit_snippet'),
]

(venv-name)$ curl http://0.0.0.0:8000/submit/
```

## Manage Complex Model Relationships

### OneToOneField Relationship

```
(venv-name)$ vi <app-name>/models.py
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models

class UserProfile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    bio = models.TextField()
```

### ForeignKey(Many-to-One) Relationship

```
(venv-name)$ vi <app-name>/models.py
class Snippet(models.Model):
    author = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='snippets')
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    code = models.TextField()
```

### ManyToManyField Relationship

```
(venv-name)$ vi <app-name>/models.py
class Tag(models.Model):
   name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
   snippets = models.ManyToManyField(Snippet, related_name='tags')
```

#### GenericForeignKey Relationship

```
from django.contrib.contenttypes.fields import GenericForeignKey
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
from django.db import models

# A single comment model can associate with any model
# ContentType refers to Django's ContentType framework
class Comment(models.Model):
    content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    object_id = models.PositiveIntegerField()
    content_object = GenericForeignKey('content_type', 'object_id')
    text = models.TextField()
```

## Define Custom QuerySet and Custom Model Manager

```
(venv-name)$ vi <app-name>/models.py
from django.db import models

class SnippetQuerySet(models.QuerySet):
    def featured(self):
        return self.filter(is_featured=True)

    def by_language(self, language):
        return self.filter(language=language)

    def short_snippets(self, max_length=100):
        return self.filter(length__lte=max_length)

class SnippetManager(models.Manager):
    def get_queryset(self):
        return SnippetQuerySet(self.model, using=self._db)

    def featured(self):
        return self.get_queryset().featured()

    def by_language(self, language):
        return self.get_queryset().by_language(language)

    def short_snippets(self, max_length=100):
        return self.get_queryset().short_snippets(max_length)

class Snippet(models.Model):
    # model fields go here

    objects = SnippetManager()
```

## Utilize Signals for Model Changes

Django includes a set of built-in signals that send notifications when certain actions occur. The most commonly used signals are pre_save, post_save, pre_delete, and post_delete, which are dispatched before or after a model's save and delete methods are called, respectively.

Signals can be used for more complex operations beyond logging, such as automatically creating related records, sending emails, or invalidating caches. The power of signals lies in their ability to execute additional logic in response to changes in your database, all while keeping your models' code clean and focused on their primary responsibilities.

```
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver

from .models import Snippet

@receiver(post_save, sender=Snippet)
def snippet_created(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if created:
        print(f"New snippet created: {instance.title}")
```

## Implement Soft Deletion in Model

### Extend Model to Support Soft Deletion

```
from django.db import models

class Snippet(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    code = models.TextField()
    language = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    is_deleted = models.BooleanField(default=False)

    def delete(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.is_deleted = True
        self.save()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

### Customize Model Manager to Exclude Soft Deleted Records

Snippet.objects.all() will return only non-deleted records.

```
class SnippetManager(models.Manager):
    def get_queryset(self):
        return super().get_queryset().filter(is_deleted=False)

class Snippet(models.Model):
    # Model fields as defined previously...
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    code = models.TextField()
    language = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    is_deleted = models.BooleanField(default=False)

    objects = SnippetManager()

    def delete(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.is_deleted = True
        self.save()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

### Retrieve Soft Deleted Records

Snippet.all_objects.all() will include both deleted and non-deleted records.

```
class AllSnippetsManager(models.Manager):
    def get_queryset(self):
        return super().get_queryset()

class Snippet(models.Model):
    # Model fields and the default manager as defined previously...
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    code = models.TextField()
    language = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    is_deleted = models.BooleanField(default=False)

    all_objects = AllSnippetsManager()
```

## Maintain Data Integrity

Ensuring data integrity is all about keeping data accurate, consistent, and reliable at all times. Multiple mechanisms in Django, such as model constraints, transaction management, and careful handling of model relationships, allow for this to be accomplished.

### Use Model Field Options

Django models offer a variety of field options that can be used to enforce data integrity at the database level. For instance, the unique attribute ensures that no two records in a table have the same value for a specific field. Additionally, null and blank can control whether a field can be empty, and choices limit the values that a field can accept.

```
class Snippet(models.Model):
    LANGUAGE_CHOICES = [
        ('PY', 'Python'),
        ('JS', 'JavaScript'),
        ('HTML', 'HTML'),
    ]

    title = models.CharField(max_length=100, unique=True)
    language = models.CharField(max_length=50, choices=LANGUAGE_CHOICES)
```

### Implement Custom Validators

```
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError

def validate_code(value):
    if "import" in value:
        raise ValidationError("Code cannot contain import statements.")

class Snippet(models.Model):
    code = models.TextField(validators=[validate_code])
```

### Utilize Transaction Management

Here, the creation of a snippet and its associated tags is atomic, ensuring that either all operations succeed or none at all, preserving database integrity.
```
from django.db import transaction

def create_snippet_with_tags(title, code, tags):
    with transaction.atomic():
        snippet = Snippet.objects.create(title=title, code=code)
        for tag in tags:
            snippet.tags.add(tag)
```

### Overide  Save and Delete Methods

This is useful for implementing custom logic before saving or deleting an object, such as validation checks or cleanup of related data.

```
class Snippet(models.Model):
    # Model fields as defined previously...

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Custom logic before saving...
        
        super().save(*args, **kwargs)

        # Custom logic after saving...
```

## Optimize Query and Index

### Add Index to Model

```
class Snippet(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100, db_index=True)
    # Other fields remain unchanged
```

### Use Meta Options for Compount Indexes

```
class Snippet(models.Model):
    # Model fields...
    
    class Meta:
        indexes = [
            models.Index(fields=['title', 'language']),
        ]
```

### Optimize Query with `select_related` and `prefetch_related`

For ForeignKey relationships, `select_related` can be used to perform a SQL join and fetch related objects in a single query. Meanwhile, `prefetch_related` is used for ManyToMany and reverse ForeignKey relationships, fetching related objects in a separate query and joining them in Python, which can be more efficient than multiple database hits.

```
# Assuming a 'user' ForeignKey
snippets = Snippet.objects.select_related('user').all()

# Assuming a 'tags' ManyToManyField
snippets = Snippet.objects.prefetch_related('tags').all()
```

## Manage URL Dispatcher and Views

### Define Dynamic Patterns with View Function

Define Dynamic URL Patterns

```
(venv-name)$ cd </path/to/proj-name>
(venv-name)$ vi <app-name>/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from . import views # import views from app module inside

urlpatterns = [
    path('snippets/<int:id>/', views.snippet_detail, name='snippet_detail'),
]

(venv-name)$ vi <app-name>/views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse
from .models import Snippet

def snippet_detail(request, id):
    try:
        snippet = Snippet.objects.get(id=id)
        return HttpResponse(f"Viewing snippet: {snippet.title}")
    except Snippet.DoesNotExist:
        return HttpResponse("Snippet not found.", status=404)
```

### Use App URL Configurations

```
(venv-name)$ cd </path/to/proj-name>
(venv-name)$ vi <proj-name>/urls.py
# include app urls to project urls
from django.urls import path, include
urlpatterns = [
    path('snippets/', include('snippets.urls')),
]
```

The above means any URL path that starts with `snippets/` will use the URL patterns defined in `snippets/urls.py`, allowing app-specific URL configurations.

### Apply App Namespacing

```
(venv-name)$ cd </path/to/proj-name>
(venv-name)$ vi <app-name>/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from . import views

# app_name variable defines the namespace
app_name = 'snippets'

urlpatterns = [
    path('<int:id>/', views.snippet_detail, name='snippet_detail'),
]
```

To reverse the snippet_detail URL in a template, you would use: 

```
{% url 'snippets:snippet_detail' id=snippet.id %}
```

### Reverse Namespaced URLs in View

```
(venv-name)$ cd </path/to/proj-name>
(venv-name)$ vi <app-name>/views.py
from django.urls import reverse
def my_view(request):
    detail_url = reverse('snippets:snippet_detail', kwargs={'id': 1})
    # Use detail_url as needed...
```

### Handle Form-Data with Class-based View (CBV)

```
(venv-name)$ cd </path/to/proj-name>
(venv-name)$ vi <app-name>/forms.py
from django import forms
from .models import Snippet

class SnippetForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Snippet
        fields = ['title', 'code', 'language']

(venv-name)$ vi <app-name>/views.py
from django.urls import reverse_lazy
from django.views.generic.edit import FormView
from .forms import SnippetForm

class SnippetCreateView(FormView):
    template_name = 'snippets/snippet_form.html'
    form_class = SnippetForm
    success_url = reverse_lazy('snippets:snippet_list')

    def form_valid(self, form):
        # This method is called when valid form data has been POSTed.
        # It should return an HttpResponse.
        form.save()
        return super().form_valid(form)

(venv-name)$ vi <app-name>/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import SnippetCreateView

urlpatterns = [
    path('create/', SnippetCreateView.as_view(), name='snippet_create'),
]

(venv-name)$ vi <app-name>/templates/snippets/snippet_form.html
<h2>Add New Snippet</h2>
<form method="post">
  {% csrf_token %}
  {{ form.as_p }}
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

### Handle Form-Data with Function-based View (FBV)

```
(venv-name)$ cd </path/to/proj-name>
(venv-name)$ vi <app-name>/forms.py
from django import forms
from .models import Snippet

class SnippetForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Snippet
        fields = ['title', 'code', 'language']

(venv-name)$ vi <app-name>/views.py
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from .forms import SnippetForm

def create_snippet(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = SnippetForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            return redirect('snippets:snippet_list')
    else:
        form = SnippetForm()
        return render(request, 'snippets/snippet_form.html', {'form': form})

(venv-name)$ vi <app-name>/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import create_snippet

urlpatterns = [
    path('create/', create_snippet, name='snippet_create'),
]

(venv-name)$ vi <app-name>/templates/snippets/snippet_form.html
<h2>Add New Snippet</h2>
<form method="post">
  {% csrf_token %}
  {{ form.as_p }}
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

### Leverage Generic View

#### Use ListView

```
(venv-name)$ vi <app-name>/views.py
from django.views.generic import ListView
from .models import Snippet

class SnippetListView(ListView):
    model = Snippet
    template_name = 'snippets/snippet_list.html'
    context_object_name = 'snippets'
```

This view automatically queries the database for all Snippet objects and passes them to the snippet_list.html template under the context variable snippets.

#### Use CreateView for Form Handling

```
(venv-name)$ vi <app-name>/views.py
from django.views.generic.edit import CreateView
from django.urls import reverse_lazy

from .models import Snippet
from .forms import SnippetForm

class SnippetCreateView(CreateView):
    model = Snippet
    form_class = SnippetForm
    template_name = 'snippets/snippet_form.html'
    success_url = reverse_lazy('snippets:snippet_list')
```

This view uses the SnippetForm, renders the snippet_form.html template for form display, and redirects to the snippet list view upon successful form submission.

#### Configure URLs for Generic View

```
(venv-name)$ vi <app-name>/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import SnippetListView, SnippetCreateView

urlpatterns = [
    path('', SnippetListView.as_view(), name='snippet_list'),
    path('create/', SnippetCreateView.as_view(), name='snippet_create'),
]
```

##  Create Custom Middleware for Request Processing

### Understand Middleware Structure

A middleware in Django is a class that defines one or more of the following methods: `__init__` (for setup, no arguments), `__call__` (to get a response for each request), and various `hook methods` (**process_response**, **process_view**, **process_exception**, **process_template_response**, etc.) to hook into different phases of the request/response lifecycle.

```
from django.utils.deprecation import MiddlewareMixin
from .models import Snippet

class SnippetCountMiddleware(MiddlewareMixin):
    def process_response(self, request, response):
        snippet_count = Snippet.objects.count()
        response['X-Snippet-Count'] = str(snippet_count)
        return response
```

### Register Middleware

```
(venv-name)$ vi <proj-name>/settings.py
MIDDLEWARE = [
    # Default Django middleware...

```

## Secure View with Permissions and User-Checks

Through the use of decorators, mixins, and custom checks, Django offers a flexible and powerful system for managing access control with a variety of user roles and permissions.

### Use Decorators for Function-Based View

Django offers the `@login_required` and `@permission_required` decorators for easy addition of access controls to function-based views.

```
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required, permission_required

@login_required
@permission_required('snippets.change_snippet', raise_exception=True)
def edit_snippet(request, id):
  # View logic here
```

### Utilize Mixins for Class-Based View

For class-based views, Django provides mixins like `LoginRequiredMixin` and `PermissionRequiredMixin` to enforce access controls.

```
from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin, PermissionRequiredMixin
from django.views.generic import UpdateView

from .models import Snippet
from .forms import SnippetForm

class EditSnippetView(LoginRequiredMixin, PermissionRequiredMixin, UpdateView):
    model = Snippet
    form_class = SnippetForm
    template_name = 'snippets/snippet_edit.html'
    permission_required = ('snippets.change_snippet',)
    # Additional view configuration...
```

### Custom User Checks

Directly examining properties of the `request.user` object in your view.

```
def custom_snippet_view(request, id):
    if not request.user.is_staff:
        return HttpResponseForbidden("You must be staff to view this.")

    # View logic for staff users...
```

## Create Advanced Template Inheritance and Filters

Thanks to advanced template inheritance, developers can make a base template with common parts like headers, footers, and navigation, and then use child templates to add to or change specific blocks of content. In addition, by using custom template filters, you can format or transform context variables directly within the templates, which significantly improves the display of data.

### Define Base Template

Start by creating a base template that includes common elements and defines blocks for overriding. In `templates/base.html`, structure your HTML with named blocks using the `{% block block_name %}{% endblock %}` tags.

```
(venv-name)$ vi <app-name>/templates/base.py
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>{% block title %}MyWebSite{% endblock %}</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <header>
      <!-- Common header content -->
    </header>

    {% block content %}
      <!-- Default content goes here if not overridden -->
    {% endblock %}

    <footer>
      <!-- Common footer content -->
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Create Child Templates

```
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% block title %}Snippet Details{% endblock %}
{% block content %}
<h1>Snippet Details</h1>
<!-- Specific content for the snippet details page -->
{% endblock %}
```

### Implement Custom Template Filters

Sometimes, you'll need to format data in a way that is not supported by Django’s built-in template filters. You can create custom filters by defining a function in a `templatetags/your_custom_filters.py` file within your app module.

```
from django import template

register = template.Library()

@register.filter(name='custom_date')
def custom_date(value):
    # Transform the value into a custom date format
    return value.strftime("%Y-%m-%d at %H:%M")
```

Use your custom filter in templates with the **|** character followed by the filter's name:

```
Published on: {{ snippet.created_at|custom_date }}
```

## Handle Static and Media Files

### Configure Static Files

The first step is to define where your static files will be stored and how they will be accessed. In your `settings.py` file, set **STATIC_URL** to specify the URL prefix to access static files, and use **STATICFILES_DIRS** to list directories where Django will search for additional static files, besides each app's **'static'** folder.

```
(venv-name)$ vi <proj-name>/settings.py
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    BASE_DIR / 'static',
]
```

For production, you should also set **STATIC_ROOT**, where Django will collect all static files using the `collectstatic` command.

```
STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'staticfiles'
```

### Manage Media files

Handling user-uploaded files requires setting up **MEDIA_ROOT** and **MEDIA_URL** in your `settings.py` file. **MEDIA_ROOT** is the filesystem path where these files will be stored, and **MEDIA_URL** is the URL prefix for serving these files.

```
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'
```

In production, ensure your web server is configured to serve the files in **MEDIA_ROOT** at the **MEDIA_URL** path. For development, you can add a URL pattern to serve media files.

```
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    # ... your URL patterns
] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
```

### Use Content Delivery Network (CDN)

For improved performance, especially in production, consider serving your static and media files through a Content Delivery Network (CDN). This involves uploading your files to a CDN service and adjusting **STATIC_URL** and/or **MEDIA_URL** to point to the CDN. Using a CDN can significantly reduce load times by serving files from a location close to the user and reducing the bandwidth load on your server.

## Create Custom Template Tags for Dynamic Content

### Setup Custom Template Tags and Filters

First, you need to create a module **within your app** to house these custom elements. In your snippets app (or whichever app you are working on), create a directory named `templatetags`. Django requires an `__init__.py` file inside this directory to recognize it as a valid Python module, so don't forget to add one. Then, create a Python file for your tags and filters, for example, `snippet_tags.py`.

### Write a Custom Template Tag

```
(venv-name)$ vi <app-name>/templatetags/snippet_tags.py
from django import template
from snippets.models import Snippet

register = template.Library()

@register.simple_tag
def get_latest_snippets(count=5):
  return Snippet.objects.order_by('-created_at')[:count]
```

This defines a simple tag called `get_latest_snippets` that returns the latest snippets. You specify the number of snippets you want with the count parameter.

### Use Custom Template Tag in Templates

To use this new tag within a template, you first need to load the tag library with `{% load snippet_tags %}` at the **top** of your template file. Then, you can use your tag as follows:

```
{% load snippet_tags %}
<ul>
  {% get_latest_snippets as latest_snippets %}
  {% for snippet in latest_snippets %}
  <li>{{ snippet.title }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

This loads the `get_latest_snippets` tag, calls it to retrieve the latest snippets, and iterates over these snippets to display their titles. This method allows you to abstract complex logic into reusable components, keeping your templates focused on presentation rather than data manipulation. Your application can dynamically now render content based on complex criteria or transformations without cluttering your templates with Python code.

## Implement Caching Strategies for Templates

### Understand Django’s Caching Framework

Django comes with a powerful caching framework that supports various backends (e.g., inmemory, file-based, cache servers like Memcached or Redis) and granular control over what gets cached and for how long. Before implementing template caching, decide on a caching backend suitable for your project’s needs and configure it in your `settings.py` file.

### Template Fragment Caching

Django provides the {% cache %} template tag for caching portions of a template that are expensive to render but change infrequently. To use it, first ensure you have the `django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache` included in your **INSTALLED_APPS**. Then, in a template, wrap the cache tag around the content you wish to cache.

```
{% load cache %}
{% cache 300 snippet_details snippet.id %}
  <!-- Expensive operations like database queries -->
  <div>{{ snippet.title }}</div>
  <div>{{ snippet.code }}</div>
{% endcache %}
```

The above sample code caches the details of a snippet for 300 seconds (5 minutes), using the snippet's ID as part of the cache key to ensure the cache is unique to each snippet.

### Invalidate Cache

Sometimes, you need to manually invalidate cached content when it changes. Django's caching framework provides methods for this. For example, if a snippet is updated, you can invalidate its cached content as below:

```
from django.core.cache import cache

def update_snippet(snippet_id, new_data):
    # Update the snippet logic here
    ...

    # Invalidate the cache
    cache_key = f'snippet_details_{snippet_id}'
    cache.delete(cache_key)
```

This makes certain that users will be able to view the revised content right away whenever a snippet is modified. One way to keep content up-to-date while still allowing for fast page loads is to cache only the parts of your pages that don't change very often.

## Optimize Template Loading

### Use Template Loaders Efficiently

Django uses template loaders to find and load templates. The order and configuration of these loaders in the **TEMPLATES** setting can impact performance. For most projects, using the `django.template.loaders.cached.Loader` wraps your existing loaders and caches compiled templates, significantly reducing load times:

```
'loaders': [
    ('django.template.loaders.cached.Loader', [
        'django.template.loaders.filesystem.Loader',
        'django.template.loaders.app_directories.Loader',
    ]),
]
```

This configuration caches templates once they're compiled, so subsequent requests for the same template don't incur the compilation overhead.

### Template Inheritance Optimization

Django’s template inheritance allows for the reuse of template code, but excessive or deep inheritance chains can lead to performance bottlenecks. Minimize the depth of inheritance where possible, and consider using template includes (`{% include 'some_template.html' %}`) for reusable components rather than basing everything on inheritance. This can reduce the complexity and number of templates that need to be loaded and rendered.

### Precompile Templates

For templates that are used very frequently and do not require dynamic context, consider precompiling them into Python code. This approach is advanced and may not be necessary for all projects, but it can reduce the template rendering time to near zero. Tools like **djangotemplate-preprocessor** can assist in this process, but be aware that this technique makes templates static and not suitable for content that changes based on context or requires localization.

### Profile Template Rendering

Use Django’s template debugging tools, such as the **Django Debug Toolbar**, to identify slow templates and tags. This can help pinpoint areas where optimization can have the most impact, whether it is simplifying complex templates, reducing the number of template tags, or caching parts of templates that are expensive to render.

## Use Formsets and Inline Formsets

Formsets in Django are a **layer** of abstraction to work with multiple forms on the same page. They allow you to create, process, and validate a set of forms as a group, making it easier to manage forms that share the same fields and validation requirements. Formsets are particularly useful for handling multiple instances of a single model.

### Define Your Form

```
from django.forms import ModelForm
from .models import Snippet

class SnippetForm(ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Snippet
        fields = ['title', 'code', 'language']
```

### Create a Formset

Use Django’s `formset_factory` to create a formset based on the `SnippetForm`:

```
from django.forms import formset_factory

SnippetFormset = formset_factory(SnippetForm, extra=3)
```

The `extra=3` parameter specifies that the formset should include three empty forms by default.

### Handle Formsets in Views

```
from django.shortcuts import render
from .forms import SnippetFormset

def add_snippets(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        formset = SnippetFormset(request.POST)
        if formset.is_valid():
            formset.save()
            # Redirect or indicate success
    else:
        formset = SnippetFormset()
        return render(request, 'add_snippets.html', {'formset': formset})
```

### Render the Formset in Templates

In your template, iterate over the `formset` to render each form, including management form data:

```
<form method="post">
  {% csrf_token %}
  {{ formset.management_form }}
  {% for form in formset %}
    {{ form.as_p }}
  {% endfor %}
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

### Inline Formsets

Inline formsets are a variation of formsets that are related to a parent model. They are particularly useful for editing related models on the same page as the parent model. Django provides `inlineformset_factory`, which works similarly to `formset_factory` but is designed for handling sets of related objects. You define an inline formset with respect to the parent model and the model form of the child model, specifying the `fk_name` if needed. Formsets are a powerful way to work with multiple forms in Django.

## Custom Form Fields and Widgets

Custom form fields in Django allow you to define how data is displayed in a form, how it is validated, and how it converts between its HTML representation and Python objects. Widgets, on the other hand, deal specifically with rendering the HTML and processing user input. Together, they offer the flexibility to create a user interface that matches your application's data and interaction patterns precisely.

### Create a Custom Form Field

Suppose you want to create a custom form field for entering comma-separated emails. This field should validate each email and save them as a list in Python.

```
from django import forms
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
from django.core.validators import validate_email

class CommaSeparatedEmailsField(forms.CharField):
    def to_python(self, value):
        """Convert the string of emails into a list."""
        if not value:
            return []
        return [email.strip() for email in value.split(',')]

    def validate(self, value):
        """Check if each email in the list is valid."""
        super().validate(value)
        for email in value:
            try:
                validate_email(email)
            except ValidationError:
                raise ValidationError(f"{email} is not a valid email address.")
```

### Create a Custom Widget

To pair with your custom field, you might want a widget that renders a text input but with specific styling or attributes. Following is a sample program on how to create a simple custom widget:

```
from django.forms.widgets import TextInput

class EmailInputWidget(TextInput):
    input_type = 'email' # Specifies the HTML input type

    def __init__(self, attrs=None):
        super().__init__(attrs)
        self.attrs.update({
            'class': 'email-input',
            'placeholder': 'Enter emails separated by commas',
        })
```

This widget extends the `TextInput` widget, setting the HTML input type to email and adding custom classes and placeholders to enhance the user interface.

### Use Custom Field and Widget

```
class EmailForm(forms.Form):
    emails = CommaSeparatedEmailsField(widget=EmailInputWidget())
```

When rendering this form in a template, the emails field will use the custom validation logic and display using the custom widget, providing a tailored experience for inputting and validating comma-separated emails.

## Implement AJAX in Form for Dynamic User Interfaces

### Setup Your Django View

First, create a view in your Django app that responds to AJAX requests. This view might check the database for username availability and return JSON indicating the result.

```
from django.http import JsonResponse
from django.views.decorators.http import require_POST

from .models import User

@require_POST
def check_username(request):
    username = request.POST.get('username', '')
    is_taken = User.objects.filter(username=username).exists()
    return JsonResponse({'is_taken': is_taken})
```

Decorate your view with @require_POST to ensure it only responds to POST requests, enhancing security.

### Configure the URL

Add a URL pattern for your AJAX view in your app’s urls.py file.

```
from django.urls import path
from .views import check_username

urlpatterns = [
    path('ajax/check_username/', check_username, name='ajax_check_username'),
]
```

### Create AJAX Call with JavaScript

On the client side, use JavaScript to send an AJAX request to the Django view when the user types a username. Include this script in the template that renders your form.

```
<script>
  document.getElementById("username").addEventListener("input", function() {
    const username = this.value;
    fetch("{% url 'ajax_check_username' %}", {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'X-CSRFToken': '{{ csrf_token }}',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ username: username })
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      if (data.is_taken) {
        document.getElementById("username_error").textContent = "Username is taken.";
      } else {
        document.getElementById("username_error").textContent = "";
      }
    });
  });
</script>
```

Ensure your form includes an element with `id="username_error"` for displaying the availability message. Also, make sure to include `{% csrf_token %}` in your form or fetch call to handle CSRF protection.

### Update Your Form Template

Modify your form template to include the JavaScript and an element to display the username availability message.

```
<input type="text" id="username" name="username">
<div id="username_error"></div>
```

## Apply Advanced Form Validation Technique

### Understand Django's Form Validation

Django forms offer a layered validation system, where you can apply validation at the field level, form level, or even using model-level clean methods. For complex validation scenarios, you might need to use a combination of these to achieve the desired results.

### Field-Level Validation

Start by defining custom validation methods within your form class for specific fields. These methods should be named `clean_<fieldname>()` and must return the `cleaned (normalized)` value or raise a **ValidationError** if the validation fails.

```
from django import forms
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError

class SnippetForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Snippet
        fields = ['title', 'code']

    def clean_code(self):
        code = self.cleaned_data['code']
        banned_keywords = ['exec', 'eval']
        for keyword in banned_keywords:
            if keyword in code:
                raise ValidationError(f"Usage of '{keyword}' is not allowed.")
        return code
```

### Form-Level Validation

For validations that involve multiple fields (e.g., ensuring two fields are not identical), implement the form's `clean()` method. This method can access the form's `cleaned_data` dictionary to perform cross-field checks.

```
def clean(self):
    cleaned_data = super().clean()
    title = cleaned_data.get("title")
    code = cleaned_data.get("code")

    if title and code and title.lower() in code.lower():
        raise ValidationError(
            "The code snippet should not contain the title."
        )

    return cleaned_data
```

### Custom Validators

For reusable validation logic, consider defining custom validator functions that can be applied to multiple form fields or even across different forms.

```
def validate_not_empty(value):
    if not value.strip():
        raise ValidationError("This field cannot be empty.")
```

Then, use this validator in your form fields as needed:

```
title = forms.CharField(validators=[validate_not_empty])
```

### Utilize Model's clean Method

You can also define a clean method in your model for an extra layer of validation that is closely tied to your data logic. This is especially useful for **enforcing constraints** that should apply regardless of the form or method used to create or update an instance. Make sure all form submissions are properly validated according to both basic and advanced rules by using Django's robust validation framework. In addition to making sure that your project's data is consistent and of high quality, this also improves the user experience by making it easier to see when they've made a mistake.

## Handle File Uploads with Forms

### Modify Model to Support File Upload

Start by adding a file field to your Snippet model. Django's `FileField` or `ImageField` (for images) makes storing uploaded files straightforward. You might also want to store metadata like the upload's original filename.

```
from django.db import models

class Snippet(models.Model):
    # Other fields...
    file = models.FileField(upload_to='snippets/')
```

The `upload_to` argument specifies a subdirectory of your **MEDIA_ROOT** setting where uploaded files will be stored.

### Create Form for File Upload

Update your `SnippetForm` to include the file field. If using a `ModelForm`, the field is automatically included; just ensure your form's HTML includes `enctype="multipart/formdata"` to support file uploads.

```
<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  {{ form.as_p }}
  <button type="submit">Upload</button>
</form>
```

### Handle File Upload in View

Modify the view that processes the form to handle the uploaded file securely. When the form is valid, you can access the file through `request.FILES`.

```
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from .forms import SnippetForm

def upload_snippet(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = SnippetForm(request.POST, request.FILES)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            return redirect('snippets:snippet_list')
    else:
        form = SnippetForm()
        return render(request, 'snippets/upload_form.html', {'form': form})
```

Note the inclusion of `request.FILES` in the form instantiation, necessary for file processing.

### Validate Uploaded Files

For security and usability, implement validation on the uploaded file, either by overriding the `clean_<fieldname>()` method in your form or by using a custom validator. You might want to check the file size, file type, or scan for malicious content.

```
def clean_file(self):
    file = self.cleaned_data['file']

    if file.size > 1024 * 1024 * 5:
        raise ValidationError("File size must be under 5MB")

    if not file.name.endswith('.py'):
        raise ValidationError("Only Python files are allowed.")

    return file
```

Ensure your template and view logic provide clear feedback on the status of file uploads, including success messages and error details for failed validations. By following these steps, you can safely integrate file upload capabilities into you project, expanding its functionality and user engagement.

## Build Multi-Step Forms

### Design Form Flow

Plan out the sequence of steps, determining what information is collected at each stage. For a code review submission, you might have steps like "Code Details," "Review Questions," and "Submit." Each step can be represented by a distinct Django form class.

### Store Intermediate Data

Utilize Django's session framework to temporarily store data between steps. This approach allows you to save the user's input at each stage without persisting it to the database until the final submission.

```
# In your view handling the first step
if form.is_valid():
    request.session['step1_data'] = form.cleaned_data
    return redirect('next_form_url')
```

### Handle Each Step

Create views for each step of the process. In each view, initialize the form with session data if available (for editing previous responses) and save the form data to the session upon successful submission.

```
# Handling the second step
initial_data = request.session.get('step2_data', {})
form = Step2Form(initial=initial_data)

if request.method == 'POST':
    form = Step2Form(request.POST)
    if form.is_valid():
        request.session['step2_data'] = form.cleaned_data
        return redirect('final_step_url')
```

### Consolidate Data for Final Submission

In the final step, consolidate data from all steps, stored in the session, to create or update the relevant model instance(s). This might involve populating a complex model or related models with the collected data.

```
if request.method == 'POST':
    # Assume all form validations have passed
    all_data = {**request.session['step1_data'], **request.session['step2_data']}
    new_review = CodeReview.objects.create(**all_data)

    # Clear the session data related to the form process
    del request.session['step1_data']
    del request.session['step2_data']
    return redirect('review_success_url')
```

It is crucial to manage the session data carefully to avoid stale or incomplete submissions. Consider adding mechanisms to clear session data at the start of the process or upon completion/cancellation.

## Secure Forms Against Common Attacks

As a main point of entry for users, forms are frequently the target of attacks like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Failing to adequately resolve these vulnerabilities could jeopardize user data and application integrity. The confidence and safety of the application users depend on the implementation of strong security measures to ward off these typical attacks.

### Prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

XSS attacks involve injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Django templates escape variables by default, which protects against XSS by ensuring that any input is rendered as text rather than executable HTML/JavaScript. Always use Django’s template system to display form data or any user-generated content. For content that includes HTML and still needs to be safe, consider using the bleach library to sanitize the input, allowing only specified tags and attributes.

```
import bleach

def clean_user_input(content):
    return bleach.clean(content, tags=['p', 'b', 'i', 'u', 'a'], attributes=['href', 'title'], strip=True)
```

### Protect Against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

CSRF attacks trick a user into executing unwanted actions on a web application in which they’re authenticated. Django counters CSRF attacks by including a secret token with each form submission, which must be present and correct for the form to be processed. Ensure `{% csrf_token %}` is included within every form in your templates. Django's middleware checks this token automatically, but always verify that `django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware` is enabled in your **MIDDLEWARE** settings.

### Guard Against SQL Injection

SQL Injection attacks involve inserting or "injecting" an SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. Django’s ORM, by default, uses parameterized queries, which effectively protect against SQL injection. Ensure that any raw SQL queries also use parameterization and avoid directly including user input in query strings.

### Validate and Sanitizing Input

Beyond leveraging Django's built-in protections, always validate and sanitize user input to enforce constraints and remove potentially harmful data. Use Django forms and model field options to enforce data types, lengths, and formats. Custom validators can provide additional layers of validation specific to your application's needs.

## Setup Custom User Model

### Create a Custom User Model

Begin by defining your custom user model in your models.py. It is recommended to extend `AbstractBaseUser` and optionally `PermissionsMixin` to get full control over the user model while retaining Django’s permissions framework.

```
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin, BaseUserManager

class CustomUserManager(BaseUserManager):
    def create_user(self, email, password=None, **extra_fields):
        if not email:
            raise ValueError('The Email field must be set')

        email = self.normalize_email(email)
        user = self.model(email=email, **extra_fields)
        user.set_password(password)
        user.save(using=self._db)
        return user

    def create_superuser(self, email, password, **extra_fields):
        extra_fields.setdefault('is_staff', True)
        extra_fields.setdefault('is_superuser', True)
        return self.create_user(email, password, **extra_fields)

class CustomUser(AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin):
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    is_staff = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    # Additional fields here

    objects = CustomUserManager()

    USERNAME_FIELD = 'email'
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = []
```

### Update `settings.py`

Inform Django about your custom user model by setting the **AUTH_USER_MODEL** in your
project’s `settings.py` file.

```
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'myapp.CustomUser'
```

Replace 'myapp' with the actual app name where your custom user model is defined.

### Migrations

After defining your custom user model and updating your settings, generate and apply migrations to create the corresponding database table.

```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Adapt Admin Interface

To manage users via Django’s admin, define a custom **ModelAdmin** class for your user model in `admin.py`.

```
from django.contrib import admin
from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin

from .models import CustomUser

class CustomUserAdmin(UserAdmin):
    model = CustomUser
    list_display = ['email', 'is_staff', 'is_active']
    # Configure additional fields as needed

    admin.site.register(CustomUser, CustomUserAdmin)
```

By creating a one-of-a-kind user model, your app is able to accommodate specific user characteristics and actions, providing the groundwork for an individualized and safe experience.

## Implement Advanced User Authentication Flows

### Email Verification Process

After a user signs up, enhance security by verifying their email address. Extend the user model to include an email verification flag and a unique verification token.

```
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractBaseUser
from django.utils.crypto import get_random_string

class CustomUser(AbstractBaseUser):
    email_verified = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    verification_token = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if not self.verification_token:
            self.verification_token = get_random_string(50)

        super().save(*args, **kwargs)
```

### Send Verification Email

After registration, send an email containing a verification link with the token. Use Django’s email utilities to send this email and a view to handle the verification link click.

```
from django.core.mail import send_mail
from django.urls import reverse
from django.shortcuts import redirect

def send_verification_email(user):
    verification_url = reverse('verify_email', args=[user.verification_token])

    send_mail(
        'Verify your GitforGits account',
        f'Please verify your account by clicking this link: {verification_url}',
        'no-reply@gitforgits.com',
        [user.email],
        fail_silently=False,
    )

def verify_email(request, token):
    user = CustomUser.objects.get(verification_token=token)
    user.email_verified = True
    user.save()
    return redirect('login')
```

### Passwordless Login

Implement a passwordless login system by sending a one-time use link or token to the user's email.

```
def send_login_email(request):
    email = request.POST['email']
    user = CustomUser.objects.get(email=email)
    token = get_random_string(50)
    user.login_token = token
    user.save()
    login_url = reverse('passwordless_login', args=[token])

    send_mail(
        'Your login link for GitforGits',
        f'Click here to log in: {login_url}',
        'no-reply@gitforgits.com',
        [email],
        fail_silently=False,
    )

    # Inform user that email was sent

def passwordless_login(request, token):
    user = CustomUser.objects.get(login_token=token)
    user.login_token = ''
    user.save()
    login(request, user)
    return redirect('dashboard')
```

Ensure your user model has fields for `login_token` and handle token cleanup for security.

## Apply Role-Based Permissions and Groups

To efficiently manage user capabilities and access rights throughout the application, Django's built-in groups and permissions framework provides a robust solution for implementing **role-based access control (RBAC)**.

### Define User Groups and Permissions

Permissions in Django are typically tied to models and can be automatically generated for add, change, delete, and view operations. For custom permissions or more granular control,
you can define them directly in your models.

```
from django.db import models

class Snippet(models.Model):
    # Model fields
    class Meta:
        permissions = [
            ("approve_snippet", "Can approve snippets"),
            ("feature_snippet", "Can mark snippets as featured"),
        ]
```

### Create Groups and Assigning Permissions

Use Django’s admin site or shell to create groups corresponding to your roles and assign the relevant permissions to each group. For example, create a "Content Creators" group with permissions to add and change snippets.

```
from django.contrib.auth.models import Group, Permission

# Creating a group for content creators
content_creators_group, created = Group.objects.get_or_create(name='Content Creators')

# Fetching model permissions
add_snippet_perm = Permission.objects.get(codename='add_snippet')
change_snippet_perm = Permission.objects.get(codename='change_snippet')

# Assigning permissions to the group
content_creators_group.permissions.add(add_snippet_perm, change_snippet_perm)
```

### Assign User to Group

Assign user to the appropriate group based on their roles. This can be done programmatically or through the Django admin interface.

```
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

# Assuming you have a user instance
user = User.objects.get(username='johndoe')
user.groups.add(content_creators_group)
```

### Checking Permissions in View

Within your views, leverage Django’s permission-checking utilities to control access. You can use decorators for function-based views and mixins for class-based views.

```
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import permission_required
from django.contrib.auth.mixins import PermissionRequiredMixin
from django.views.generic import View

# For function-based views
@permission_required('snippets.add_snippet', raise_exception=True)
def add_snippet(request):
    # View logic

# For class-based views
class FeatureSnippetView(PermissionRequiredMixin, View):
    permission_required = 'snippets.feature_snippet'
    # View logic
```

With Django's role-based permissions and groups, you can build an authorization system that is secure, scalable, and compatible with GitforGits's varied requirements. Users' interactions with the platform should be in line with their responsibilities, which improves security and user experience. This can be achieved by clearly defining roles and carefully managing permissions.

## Implement OAuth and Social Authentication


### Choose Auth Library

`Django-allauth` is a popular package that provides comprehensive support for social authentication, handling the complexities of OAuth protocols and integrating with a wide range of providers. Start by installing Django-allauth in your virtual environment:

```
pip install django-allauth
```

### Configure `settings.py`

Add `django.contrib.sites`, `allauth`, `allauth.account`, and `allauth.socialaccount` to your **INSTALLED_APPS**. Also, configure the Django sites framework by setting **SITE_ID**, typically to 1, and add allauth's authentication backends.

```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # Other apps...
    'django.contrib.sites',
    'allauth',
    'allauth.account',
    'allauth.socialaccount',
    # Providers (e.g., Google, Facebook)
    'allauth.socialaccount.providers.google',
]

AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
    'allauth.account.auth_backends.AuthenticationBackend',
]

SITE_ID = 1
```

### Update URLs

Include allauth URLs in your project’s `urls.py` to make the authentication views available.

```
urlpatterns = [
    # Other URLs...
    path('accounts/', include('allauth.urls')),
]
```

### Configuring Providers

Visit the **admin panel** to configure the social applications (e.g., Google, Facebook) with the credentials obtained from their developer consoles. This typically involves specifying a client ID and secret key and setting the callback URLs as required by each provider.

### Customize Templates and Flows

While Django-allauth provides default templates, customizing them to match your application’s look and feel can offer a seamless user experience.

### Handle Post-Login Actions

Consider implementing signals or overriding allauth’s adapters to perform actions after a successful login, such as fetching additional user information from the provider or creating user profiles within your application.

This entire method streamlines the login process and follows current web standards, which improves the user experience and may lead to more engagement on the platform.

## Manage User Sessions and Cookies

The stateless HTTP protocol relies on sessions and cookies to keep state, which allows for secure authentication and personalized user experiences. When these components are handled correctly, our application allows users to navigate without any issues, and their authentication state and preferences are saved from one visit to the next. Furthermore, in order to optimize performance and maintain security standards, it is essential to manage sessions and cookies mindfully. This will prevent vulnerabilities like session hijacking.

### Configure Django Session Framework

Django's session framework provides a robust mechanism for storing information on the server side, with a key referenced in a user’s cookie. Ensure your Django project is configured to use the desired session engine in `settings.py`:

```
# Use database-backed sessions
SESSION_ENGINE = 'django.contrib.sessions.backends.db'
# Or, for better performance with cache setup
SESSION_ENGINE = 'django.contrib.sessions.backends.cached_db'
```

Run `python manage.py migrate` if using database-backed sessions to set up the necessary database tables.

### Configure Session Security Settings

Configure session security settings in `settings.py` to enhance security. For instance, use HTTPS for cookie transmission, set the session cookie as HttpOnly to prevent client-side scripts from accessing the session ID, and enable **SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE** to clear sessions when the browser is closed:

```
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True
SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE = True
```

### Manage Sessions in View

Use Django’s session framework to store and retrieve data within your views. For example, storing a user’s theme preference might involve:

```
def set_theme(request):
    theme = request.GET.get('theme', 'light')
    request.session['theme'] = theme
    return HttpResponse(f"Theme set to {theme}")
```

### Customize Cookies

While sessions are suitable for most use cases, directly setting cookies on the client may be necessary for certain scenarios, such as tracking anonymous user preferences. Use Django’s `response` objects to set cookies:

```
def set_preference(request):
    response = HttpResponse("Preference saved")
    response.set_cookie('preferred_language', 'python')
    return response
```

Consider cookie attributes such as expires, max_age, secure, and httponly for finer control and enhanced security.

### Cookie and Session Cleanup

Regularly clearing expired sessions from the database helps maintain performance. Django includes a management command for this purpose:

```
python manage.py clearsessions
```

Automate this command with a scheduled task (e.g., cron job) to keep the session table optimized.

## Customize Django Authentication Form

### Extend Authentication Forms

Begin by extending the existing authentication forms to add custom fields or modify existing ones. For example, to add a 'remember me' option to the login form, you could extend `AuthenticationForm` as below:

```
from django import forms
from django.contrib.auth.forms import AuthenticationForm

class CustomAuthenticationForm(AuthenticationForm):
    remember_me = forms.BooleanField(required=False, label='Remember me')
```

This adds a new field to the form without altering the underlying authentication logic.

### Customize Form Layout and Validation

Override the `__init__` method of your custom form to apply custom styling or initialize fields in a specific way. You can also add clean methods to include custom validation for your new fields or override existing validation logic.

```
def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
    super(CustomAuthenticationForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
    self.fields['username'].widget.attrs.update({'class': 'custom-class'})
    self.fields['remember_me'].initial = True

def clean_remember_me(self):
    # Custom validation logic for remember_me
    return self.cleaned_data['remember_me']
```

### Integrate Custom Forms into View

Use your custom form in Django's authentication views by either extending the existing authentication views or by specifying the form explicitly if using class-based views. For example, to use the custom authentication form in a class-based login view:

```
from django.contrib.auth.views import LoginView

class CustomLoginView(LoginView):
    form_class = CustomAuthenticationForm
```

Update your URL configuration to use this custom view instead of the default login view.

### Render Custom Forms in Templates

Customize the template used by your form to ensure it reflects the added fields and matches the site’s styling. Remember to load and display form errors to provide feedback to the user.

```
<form method="post">
  {% csrf_token %}
  {{ form.as_p }}
  <button type="submit">Login</button>
</form>
```

## Implementing Two-Factor Authentication

By incorporating two-factor authentication (2FA), an extra safeguard is created, drastically decreasing the likelihood of unwanted entry. Users are prompted to submit two pieces of identification in order to access their accounts when using two-factor authentication (2FA). This typically involves something the user knows (like a password) and something the user has (like a
code sent to their mobile device).

### Choose 2FA Method

Decide on the methods of 2FA you want to offer. Common options include SMS codes, email codes, or time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) generated by an app like Google Authenticator or Authy. TOTP is a popular choice due to its higher security compared to SMS.

### Integrate with a Third-Party Service

For SMS or email-based 2FA, integrate with a third-party service like Twilio or SendGrid. These services offer APIs to send messages or emails containing the 2FA codes. For TOTP, libraries like `django-otp` or `pyotp` can be used to generate and verify tokens.

### Modify User Model

Extend your user model to store 2FA-related information. For TOTP, you might store a secret key for each user.

```
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser

import pyotp

class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
    two_factor_enabled = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    otp_secret_key = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True, default='')

    def generate_totp_secret(self):
        if not self.otp_secret_key:
            self.otp_secret_key = pyotp.random_base32()
        self.save()
```

### 2FA Setup and Verification Flow

Create views and templates for users to enable 2FA, including generating a QR code for TOTP that users can scan with their authentication app. Use `pyotp` to generate the QR code URL.

```
import pyotp

def setup_2fa(request):
    user = request.user
    user.generate_totp_secret()
    otp_uri = pyotp.totp.TOTP(user.otp_secret_key).provisioning_uri(user.email, issuer_name="GitforGits")

    # Render a template that displays the QR code and a form to verify the token
```

### Verify 2FA at Login

Extend the login process to include a second step for 2FA verification. After the user successfully enters their password, prompt them for their 2FA code. Verify the code against the user’s secret key or the code received via SMS/email.

```
def verify_2fa_code(request):
    user = request.user
    token = request.POST.get('token')
    totp = pyotp.TOTP(user.otp_secret_key)

    if totp.verify(token):
        # Log the user in and redirect to the dashboard
    else:
        # Return an error message
```

## Manage User Account Activation and Password Reset

### Account Activation via Email

* User Model Extension: Ensure your user model includes a field for tracking email verification status, such as `email_verified = models.BooleanField(default=False)`.
* Sending Activation Emails: Upon user registration, generate a unique activation token and send an email with a link containing this token. Use Django’s built-in `send_mail` function or a third-party service for email delivery.
* Activation View: Create a view that validates the activation token from the email link, sets the user’s `email_verified` flag to True, and completes the account activation process.
* Email Template: Craft a clear and concise email template for the activation email, including instructions on how to activate the account.

### Password Reset Process

* Password Reset Views: Leverage Django’s built-in views for password reset: `PasswordResetView` for submitting the email form, `PasswordResetDoneView` for confirming that the reset email has been sent, `PasswordResetConfirmView` for the actual password reset form where the user inputs a new password, and `PasswordResetCompleteView` for confirming the password has been changed.
* Email Integration: Customize the email template used by `PasswordResetView` to align with your site’s branding and provide clear instructions. Ensure your email backend is correctly configured in Django settings.
* URL Configuration: Include the URLs for Django’s password reset views in your project’s `urls.py`. Customize the URL patterns if necessary to fit your site’s routing schema.
* Security Considerations: Ensure the password reset process is secure. Django’s views already include necessary security checks, such as token validation and expiration.

## Setting up and Configuring DRF

### Install DRF

Begin by adding DRF to your project. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install djangorestframework
```

### Update Installed App

Next, add `'rest_framework'` to the **INSTALLED_APPS** section of your project's `settings.py` file. This step makes Django aware of the DRF application and its components.

```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'rest_framework',
]
```

### Configure DRF Settings

DRF comes with a wide range of settings that allow you to customize its behavior to fit your project. In your `settings.py`, you can start by defining some basic configurations under the **REST_FRAMEWORK** setting. For example, setting up default permissions and pagination:

```
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly',
    ],
    'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS': 'rest_framework.pagination.PageNumberPagination',
    'PAGE_SIZE': 10,
}
```

These settings specify that by default, API access should be restricted to authenticated users for write operations while allowing read-only access to unauthenticated users, and enable pagination for API responses.

### Initial API Routing

Define a URLconf for your API by creating a `urls.py` file in your **app** directory (if not already present) or the project directory. Use DRF's router classes for easy URL routing of viewsets:

```
from django.urls import include, path
from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter

from yourapp import views

router = DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'snippets', views.SnippetViewSet)

urlpatterns = [
    path('api/', include(router.urls)),
]
```

This setup declares a simple API route for accessing snippet resources, assuming you have a `SnippetViewSet` defined in your views.

### Enable Browsable API

One of DRF's standout features is its browsable API, which is enabled by default. This allows developers and users to interact with the API directly from their browsers, a great tool for testing and exploring your API's capabilities.

## Build First API View

### Define Serializer

Before creating the view, you need a way to convert your model instances into a format that can be easily rendered into JSON or XML for API responses. DRF’s serializers handle this task. Define a serializer for your Snippet model in a new file `serializers.py` within your **app**.

```
from rest_framework import serializers

from .models import Snippet

class SnippetSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Snippet
        fields = ['id', 'title', 'code', 'created_at']
```

This serializer specifies which fields to include in the serialized representation of Snippet instances.

### Create View

Utilize DRF's viewsets or generic views to handle the logic of your API endpoint. For a simple read-only list of snippets, a generic ListAPIView can be used:

```
from rest_framework.generics import ListAPIView

from .models import Snippet
from .serializers import SnippetSerializer

class SnippetListView(ListAPIView):
    queryset = Snippet.objects.all()
    serializer_class = SnippetSerializer
```

This view automatically handles GET requests, returning a list of all Snippet instances in serialized form.

### URL Configuration

Link your API view to a URL. If you haven’t done so already, set up a URLconf in your **app**. Use DRF’s `DefaultRouter` for viewsets or include your API views directly for generic views:

```
from django.urls import path

from .views import SnippetListView

urlpatterns = [
    path('snippets/', SnippetListView.as_view(), name='snippet-list'),
]
```

This makes your snippet list API accessible at `/snippets/`, providing a straightforward endpoint for clients to interact with. To access the endpoint, you just set up, launch your Django development server. You may easily build scalable endpoints that retrieve application data efficiently by creating serializers and using DRF's built-in views.

## Work with Serializers for Complex Data

Serializers in DRF play a crucial role in converting complex queryset and model instances into JSON and vice versa. They provide a powerful mechanism for dealing with nested data, serialization of multiple objects, and custom fields.

### Implement Nested Serializer

To handle nested objects, define serializers for each level of your data model. For instance, if you have models for User, Snippet, and Comment, create a serializer for each.

```
from rest_framework import serializers

from .models import User, Snippet, Comment

class CommentSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Comment
        fields = ('id', 'body', 'author')

class SnippetSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    comments = CommentSerializer(many=True, read_only=True)

    class Meta:
        model = Snippet
        fields = ('id', 'title', 'code', 'comments')

class UserSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    snippets = SnippetSerializer(many=True, read_only=True)

    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ('id', 'username', 'snippets')
```

This setup allows you to serialize a User instance including their snippets and the comments on those snippets, fully representing the nested relationships in your data.

### Write Custom Create and Update Method

For nested serializers, you may need to override the `.create()` and `.update()` methods to properly handle nested data on write operations.

```
class SnippetSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    # Assume we have a field `comments_data` for creating/updating comments
    comments_data = CommentSerializer(many=True, write_only=True)

    class Meta:
        model = Snippet
        fields = '__all__'

    def create(self, validated_data):
        comments_data = validated_data.pop('comments_data')
        snippet = Snippet.objects.create(**validated_data)
        for comment_data in comments_data:
            Comment.objects.create(snippet=snippet, **comment_data)
        return snippet
```

This allows for the creation of a Snippet instance along with its associated Comments in one go, handling the nested data structure efficiently.

### Handle Complex Reads and Writes

Use DRF’s depth option for read operations if you only need nested representations and not nested writes. For complex writes, as shown above, carefully manage the relationships and data integrity in your custom create and update methods. Mastering nested serializers and custom methods for handling complex data ensures that the application can accommodate a rich feature set while maintaining clarity and integrity in data relationships.

## Implementing Authentication and Permissions in APIs

### Authentication and Permissions in DRF

While authentication verifies the user making the request, permissions establish whether or not the user has the authority to carry out the requested task. Custom permission classes can be applied globally or to specific views, and DRF supports several authentication techniques including OAuth and Token Authentication.

### Configuring Authentication

To use token authentication, which assigns a unique token to each user, first add the token
authentication scheme to your `settings.py`:

```
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication',
    ],
    ...
}
```

Then, run `python manage.py migrate` to create the necessary database tables for storing tokens. You'll need to generate and assign tokens to your users, which can be done manually via the admin site or programmatically during user registration.

### Create Permission Classes

Define custom permissions for actions like editing or deleting a snippet. Create a new file `permissions.py` in your **app** directory and define a permission class:

```
from rest_framework import permissions

class IsOwnerOrReadOnly(permissions.BasePermission):
    def has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj):
        if request.method in permissions.SAFE_METHODS:
            return True
        return obj.owner == request.user
```

This permission class allows read-only access to unauthenticated users but restricts write permissions to the object's owner.

### Apply Authentication and Permissions to Views

Update your API views to use the configured authentication classes and custom permissions. For DRF's class-based views or viewsets, you can set the `authentication_classes` and `permission_classes` attributes:

```
from rest_framework.authentication import TokenAuthentication

from .permissions import IsOwnerOrReadOnly

class SnippetDetailView(RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView):
    ...
    authentication_classes = [TokenAuthentication]
    permission_classes = [IsOwnerOrReadOnly]
```

Ensure that your snippet **model** includes an **owner** field that references the user who created it, and adjust view logic accordingly. This setup not only protects user data on GitforGits but also provides a flexible framework for defining complex access control policies tailored to your application's needs.

## Customize Pagination and Filtering

### Customize Pagination

DRF supports several pagination styles, but you can create a custom pagination class to define your own pagination behavior. For example, to implement a pagination style that includes the total number of pages and the current page in the response, extend the `PageNumberPagination` class and set the `page_size` to determine how many items to display per page.

```
from rest_framework.pagination import PageNumberPagination
from rest_framework.response import Response

class CustomPagination(PageNumberPagination):
    page_size = 10
    page_size_query_param = 'page_size'
    max_page_size = 100

    def get_paginated_response(self, data):
        return Response({
            'links': {
                'next': self.get_next_link(),
                'previous': self.get_previous_link()
            },
            'total_pages': self.page.paginator.num_pages,
            'current_page': self.page.number,
            'page_size': self.page_size,
            'results': data
        })
```

In your view, specify this custom pagination class in the `pagination_class` attribute.

### Implement Filtering

DRF allows for various filtering backends, but for custom filtering logic, you can override the `get_queryset` method in your view. For instance, to filter code snippets by the programming language, you might include:

```
def get_queryset(self):
    queryset = Snippet.objects.all()
    language = self.request.query_params.get('language', None)
    if language is not None:
        queryset = queryset.filter(language=language)
    return queryset
```

This allows API clients to filter the snippets list by appending a ?language=python parameter to the URL.

### Register Custom Pagination Component

In your project’s settings, register the custom pagination class under the **REST_FRAMEWORK** configuration to apply it globally, or apply it to specific views as needed.

```
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    ...
    'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS': 'path.to.CustomPagination',
    ...
}
```

## Best Practices for API Versioning

### Choose a Versioning Scheme

DRF supports various versioning schemes out of the box, including URL path versioning, query parameter versioning, and header versioning. The choice of scheme depends on your API's specific needs and the preferences of its consumers. URL path versioning (`/api/v1/`) is one of the most straightforward and commonly used methods, offering clear and explicit versioning.

### Configure Versioning in DRF

To set up URL path versioning in your project, update the **DEFAULT_VERSIONING_CLASS** in your `settings.py` to use
`rest_framework.versioning.URLPathVersioning`. Also, specify a default version and allowed versions:

```
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_VERSIONING_CLASS': 'rest_framework.versioning.URLPathVersioning',
    'DEFAULT_VERSION': 'v1',
    'ALLOWED_VERSIONS': ['v1', 'v2'],
    'VERSION_PARAM': 'version',
}
```

### Adapt Your URLs and Views

Modify your `urls.py` to include the version in the URL path. DRF's path function supports versioning directly:

```
from django.urls import path, include
from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter

from . import views

# Assuming you have a router set up for your views
router = DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'snippets', views.SnippetViewSet)

urlpatterns = [
    path('api/<version>/', include(router.urls)),
]
```

In your views, you can access the version of the request via request.version and adjust the behavior accordingly.

### Communicat Changes and Deprecations

Clearly document available versions, changes in each version, and any deprecated features or endpoints. Communication with your API consumers is key to a smooth transition between versions. Consider providing migration guides or examples to help users adapt to new versions.

### Deprecation Policy

Establish a deprecation policy outlining how long old versions will be supported. This policy helps
manage expectations and provides a clear timeline for transitioning between API versions.

## Test DRF Application

### Setup the Test Environment

Configure your Django project to use a separate database for testing to avoid interfering with your development data. This can typically be done in your project's `settings.py` by customizing the **DATABASES** setting when **TEST** is in the environment variables.

### Test DRF View

DRF includes a `APIClient` class, extending Django's `Client` test class, that simulates requests to the API and is aware of things like authentication.

```
from rest_framework.test import APIClient
from django.urls import reverse
from rest_framework import status

import pytest

@pytest.mark.django_db
def test_snippet_list():
    client = APIClient()
    url = reverse('snippet-list')
    response = client.get(url)
    assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_200_OK
```

The above sample program tests that the snippet list view returns a 200 OK response, indicating it is accessible as expected.

### Test Authentication and Permissions

Use the `force_authenticate` method with the `APIClient` to simulate authenticated requests in your tests.

```
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from rest_framework.test import APIClient

from .models import Snippet

def test_create_snippet_authenticated():
    client = APIClient()
    user = User.objects.create_user('testuser', 'test@gitforgits.com', 'testpassword')
    client.force_authenticate(user=user)
    url = reverse('snippet-list')
    data = {'title': 'Test Snippet', 'code': 'print("hello, world")'}
    response = client.post(url, data, format='json')
    assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_201_CREATED
```

This test ensures authenticated users can create snippets.

### Integration Testing

Beyond individual unit tests, consider writing integration tests that test the API's workflow from end to end. These tests can simulate a user's interaction with multiple endpoints and validate the overall functionality and performance of your API.

### Continuous Integration

Integrate your tests into a CI/CD pipeline to automatically run them against every commit or pull request. This practice helps identify issues early and improves code quality.

## Debugg DRF Application

### Leverage DRF's Browsable API

One of DRF's most powerful features for development and debugging is its browsable API interface. It not only provides a human-friendly way to interact with your API but also displays useful debugging information such as request and response data, status codes, and headers. When encountering an issue, first use the browsable API to replicate the problem and observe any errors or unexpected output.

### Django Debug Toolbar

The Django Debug Toolbar is an invaluable tool for debugging Django applications, including those using DRF. It offers detailed insights into the SQL queries generated by your views, performance data, request and response headers, and more. To use it with DRF, ensure your API views are capable of rendering HTML responses or temporarily switch to a standard Django view while debugging.

```
INSTALLED_APPS += ['debug_toolbar']
MIDDLEWARE += ['debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware']
DEBUG_TOOLBAR_CONFIG = {
    'SHOW_TOOLBAR_CALLBACK': lambda request: True, # Forces the toolbar to show for DRF views
}
```

### Logging

Properly configured logging can provide insights into your application's behavior, capturing detailed information about requests, responses, and system errors. Django’s logging framework is highly configurable, allowing you to log messages at various severity levels and output logs to different destinations (console, file, email, etc.).

```
LOGGING = {
    'version': 1,
    'disable_existing_loggers': False,
    'handlers': {
        'console': {
            'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
        },
    },
    'loggers': {
        'django': {
            'handlers': ['console'],
            'level': 'DEBUG',
        },
    },
}
```

### Postman and cURL for Testing API Calls

Tools like Postman or cURL can simulate client requests to your API, offering a way to methodically test and debug various API endpoints. They are particularly useful for debugging authentication issues, testing header configurations, and replicating client-reported errors.

### DRF's Exception Handling

Customize DRF's exception handling to catch and log exceptions or to modify the response data for errors. DRF provides hooks for custom exception handling, which can be used to add debugging information to error responses or integrate with error tracking services.

## Implement Throttling and Rate Limiting for API

### Understand Throttling in DRF

Throttling in DRF allows you to define limits on how often a user can make requests to your API within a given timeframe. These limits can be applied globally or to individual views, and DRF includes several throttling classes to suit different use cases.

### Configure Throttling Settings

To implement throttling, start by specifying the desired throttling classes and rates in your project's `settings.py`. DRF provides `SimpleRateThrottle` for basic use cases, and you can define custom rates:

```
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.throttling.AnonRateThrottle',
        'rest_framework.throttling.UserRateThrottle'
    ],
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES': {
        'anon': '100/day',
        'user': '1000/day'
    }
}
```

This configuration sets a rate limit of 100 requests per day for unauthenticated users and 1,000 for authenticated users.

### Create Custom Throttle Classes

For more complex scenarios, you can create custom throttle classes by subclassing `BaseThrottle`. This is particularly useful for implementing rate limits based on criteria other than user identity or IP address, such as endpoint-specific throttling:

```
from rest_framework.throttling import SimpleRateThrottle

class SnippetCreateThrottle(SimpleRateThrottle):
    scope = 'snippet_create'

    def get_cache_key(self, request, view):
        if request.method == 'POST':
            return request.user.id
        return None
```

Then, add `'snippet_create': '10/hour'` to **DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES** and apply your custom throttle to specific views.

### Apply Throttling to View

Throttling can be applied to views by setting the `throttle_classes` attribute. For class-based views or viewsets, you can directly specify which throttling classes to use:

```
from rest_framework.throttling import UserRateThrottle

from .throttling import SnippetCreateThrottle

class SnippetListView(ListCreateAPIView):
    throttle_classes = [UserRateThrottle, SnippetCreateThrottle]
    # View setup continues...
```

### Handle Throttling Responses

When a request exceeds the defined rate limits, DRF will return a 429 Too Many Requests response. Customize the response or inform users about the throttling policy through documentation and API error messages.
